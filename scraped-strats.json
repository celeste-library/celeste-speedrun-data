The best I got with a single climb jump very late before the transition was breaking even accounting for the beginning of the next room too (losing one frame only looking at this room, so must save a frame in the next). Climb jumping more / earlier is slower. (I got the funny neutral cb thing the TAS does to save up to 2 frames but it's awful). So yeah, easiest exit here is also the fastest.",

Press a jump + pause key twice. Repeat this six more times (7 times in total). Then press pause, keep holding right, and buffer the climb jump.\n\nFor the second version:\nGrab onto the wall as shown in the video, then drop down. Jump and hold right at the same time after reaching the ground. Keep holding jump and right until you are close to the wall. Then start holding grab and spam a jump + pause button while continuing to hold right and jump. Stop spamming the button after you have cleared the spikes, then make sure you are unpaused (keep holding right and jump). Most of the time you should have climb jumped 3 times, so you will need to recover your stamina with the dash crystal. Simply grab the left wall, climb jump, then jump over to the right wall.\n\nThe second version is about 1.2 seconds faster optimally, however its seems less consistent to me (sometimes you only jump twice which messes up the dash refill, if you start holding right to early after dropping from the wall that will also make it less consistent).",

You can get a feel for when its a good/bad cb by the speed you have, and you have more than enough time to think about what strat to do during screen transition",

I think there will be some future tweaks but feels pretty good IMO. the only bounce that its not either min or max height is the 5th.        edit: this seems to also work entering on the right side be buffering a full height wall climb and doing all the same stuff.",

I have been doing a lot of testing and have compared 4 ways of doing flag 14, the \"standard\" strat (strat2), the IL WR strat (strat3), the wall kick skip (strat4) and my own strat which I have come up with (strat 1) the times are as follows 1 :4.352   2: 4.811  3:4.556   4: 4.488. this was timed from flag 14 respawn to the highest pixel you can climb to on the right wall. there may be flaws in the movement but I made my best attempt to do each strat as fast as I could.  for strat 1 make sure you dash into the left side of the spring and then hold right and down. this will get you just over the wall but you will still need to turn around for the wall kick.",

    "description": "so after a lot of testing I have come to the following conclusion as to the routing of 2A FC and ARB route 3 seems to be optimal by a few frames in both categories. this gap widens a bit in FC if not doing the cycle skip because it allows you to collect 3 berries for free. this also risks 3 berries doing the cycle skip or loses the time to collect them before the tape room making it no longer worth it. taking this all into consideration I believe route 3 is best for IL's in both categories. full game FC: route 1 is best full game doing the cycle skip, route 3 is best full game not doing the cycle skip, full game ARB: I believe route 3 should be best here but in the longer category honestly just go with the route that feels better.  edit: route 2 is viable and loses very little time, it just does not seem to be optimal.",

    "description": "#9 #farewell #100% found a new jelly preservation that saves over a second. make sure to jump after doing the down dash on the power block so you can make it to the moon block with a left dash, and throw the jelly to the left as late as possible while still being able to land on the moon block. This way of hitting the power box is also good for any other jelly preservation strat since you can make it back to the jelly much faster.  the right dash to do the first hit on the power block is also fast even if not going for the moon berry.",
